# Stakkit

##Information

* The app has a built-in social network that allows Users to communicate with each other about all things medical/health related. Users can do the usual things such as upload photos, videos, share supplement stacks, favorite stacks, follow other Users etc... There is even a User activity feed to keep track of everything that is going on within the world of the app.
* One cool feature that is still in development is Quora-like functionality. Users can ask health/supplement related Questions and Answer these Questions in Wiki fashion. The Wiki will be completely User-moderated and will hopefully provide a valuable source of information (ala Wikipedia) over time. 

* Source code [available on Gitbub](https://github.com/alexhawkins/stakkit) 

* Demo available on [Heroku](http://www.stakkit.com/)
